6. **"Near-Miss" to "Hazard" Conversion:** A one-click workflow to convert a reported near-miss into a new entry in the Risk Register.
7. **OSHA/Regulatory Auto-Logging:** Logic that automatically flags if an incident meets "Recordable" criteria for official regulatory reporting (e.g., OSHA 300 logs).
8. **Anonymous Reporting (Whistleblower) Channel:** A public-facing portal allowing employees to report observations without logging into the main system.
9. **Real-Time SMS/Push Notifications:** Instant alerts for "Fatality/Serious" severity incidents sent to the Emergency Response Team.
10. **Evidence Vault:** A specialized file-management section within incident details to store high-resolution forensic photos and body-cam footage.

### **Risk Assessment & Hazard Control**

11. **Dynamic Risk Matrix Configuration:** Allow admins to customize the 5x5 matrix dimensions (e.g., 3x3 or 6x6) in the Configuration page.
12. **Control Effectiveness Monitoring:** A periodic workflow to review if "Control Measures" are still performing as intended.
13. **Chemical Inventory (SDS) Integration:** Link Risk Assessments directly to a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) database for chemical hazards.
14. **Job Safety Analysis (JSA) Creator:** A specific workflow for field workers to create and sign off on JSAs before starting a high-risk task.
15. **Residual Risk Trend Tracking:** Visualize how residual risk scores change over time across different departments on the Dashboard.
16. **Hazard Library:** A repository of "Common Hazards" that users can select from when creating an assessment to ensure terminology consistency.
17. **Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) Support:** Add fields for calculating financial or environmental impact in monetary terms alongside 1-5 scores.
18. **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Matrix:** Automatically suggest required PPE based on the selected Hazard Category (e.g., Chemical vs. Physical).
19. **Risk Heatmaps:** A visual site map overlay showing "hot zones" based on high-risk assessments.
20. **Actionable Alerts for "Inadequate" Status:** Automated triggers that prevent work permits from being issued if a related risk is marked "Inadequate".

### **Audit & Inspection Functionalities**

21. **Mobile-First Offline Mode:** Allow inspectors to complete checklists in areas without internet and sync data when back online.
22. **Voice-to-Text Checklist Entry:** Integrated dictation for "Findings" to allow hands-free inspections.
23. **Checklist Versioning:** The ability to update checklist templates without losing historical data from previous versions.
24. **Conditional Logic in Checklists:** Hide or show questions based on previous answers (e.g., if "Is equipment powered?" is "No," skip electrical safety questions).
25. **Photo Annotations:** Allow users to draw on or highlight specific areas in photos attached to audit findings.
26. **Recurring Audit Scheduling:** An automated calendar that generates "Planned" audits monthly or annually.
27. **External Auditor Access Role:** A restricted user role specifically for third-party auditors to view compliance records only.
28. **Benchmarking Reports:** Compare audit scores between different facility locations on a single dashboard view.
29. **Corrective Action Auto-Generation:** Automatically create a CAPA item if a critical checklist item is marked "Non-Compliant".
30. **Digital Signature Verification:** Biometric or PIN-based signatures for audit completion to ensure non-repudiation.

### **Compliance & Training Workflows**

31. **Regulatory Update Feed:** An integrated newsfeed that pulls EHS regulatory changes based on the company's "Compliance" jurisdiction.
32. **Training Competency Gap Analysis:** A report that cross-references employee roles with required certifications to show missing training.
33. **Automated Re-certification Reminders:** System-generated emails sent 30/60/90 days before a "Training Record" expires.
34. **E-Learning Module Integration:** Allow employees to watch safety videos and take quizzes directly within the "Training" module.
35. **Permit-to-Work (PTW) Approval Workflow:** A multi-step digital sign-off process for high-risk work like Confined Space or Hot Work.
36. **Contractor Compliance Verification:** A portal for contractors to upload their insurance and safety plans before being allowed on-site.
37. **Legal Register Tracking:** Link specific "Compliance Records" to specific clauses in national or international safety laws.
38. **Automatic Certificate Generation:** PDF certificates automatically generated for employees upon successful completion of training.
39. **Employee Health Surveillance:** A secure sub-module for tracking occupational health checkups and audiometry results.
40. **Safety Meeting/Toolbox Talk Tracker:** A workflow to document meeting attendance and topics discussed with digital sign-in sheets.

### **System Integration & Advanced Analytics**

41. **Custom Report Builder:** A "drag-and-drop" interface for admins to create specialized reports beyond the standard Dashboard.
42. **API Integrations:** Standardized hooks to connect EHS data with HR systems (e.g., Workday) or Maintenance systems (e.g., SAP).
43. **Lagging vs. Leading Indicator Ratios:** Specialized dashboard widgets comparing incident rates (lagging) to inspection completion rates (leading).
44. **Data Export to PowerBI/Tableau:** Native connectors to push EHS metrics into corporate BI tools for executive review.
45. **Multi-Language Support:** A localization workflow to allow the UI to switch between English, Spanish, French, etc., for global teams.
46. **Audit Trail for Data Changes:** A backend log showing who changed a record, what was changed, and when (critical for legal defensibility).
47. **Document Control Center:** A centralized, version-controlled repository for EHS Policies, Procedures, and Manuals.
48. **Sustainability/ESG Reporting:** Add tracking for carbon footprint, water usage, and waste management metrics.
49. **Predictive Analytics:** Use historical data to predict "High Risk" days or shifts based on past incident trends.
50. **Mobile App Offline Notifications:** Ability for the system to send local push-reminders for scheduled inspections even if the phone is offline.
